      "At Airbnb, hosts with a hospitality mindset outperform those who treat it like a side hustle. Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, says, 'Design is not just what it looks like. Design is how it works—and hospitality is the same.' That’s why top-performing hosts use checklists, templated messages, and mood lighting—all systems that create intentional warmth."

That’s what a hospitality system answers. Start by identifying your non-negotiables. For us, it was remembering names, delivering under-promised timelines, and handwritten thank-you notes after every project launch."

      "It was a rainy Thursday when I first opened the lid of my tiny coffee cart, parked between a bookstore and a dry cleaner. I had no fancy branding, no followers, and certainly no budget for ads. But I had a hunch: what I lacked in noise, I could make up for in nuance. That day, without knowing it, I began to learn the art of positioning—by selling coffee."

    content:
      "At first, it felt like shouting into a void. Customers walked past, barely noticing the cart. So I started asking myself, 'What makes them stop?' Was it the smell of beans, the design of the cart, or the fact that I remembered their names after one visit? The answer, I discovered, was less about what I served and more about how I stood out."

Instead of a full menu, I had a sign that read: 'We make coffee for people who walk fast and think deeply.' That one sentence changed everything."
